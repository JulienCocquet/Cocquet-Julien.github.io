# Hi!

I am PhD student in [Shanghai Center for Mathematics Science](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/) at **Fudan university**, Shanghai, China. My supervisor is **Hehui Wu**. My bachelor degree was also completed at Fudan uniiversity. 

Currently I am enjoying my visit at [MC2 team](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/MC2/) in [LIP](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP) at **ENS Lyon**, Lyon, France, supported by Chinese Scholarship Council. My supervisor in ENS is [**Stéphan Thomassé**](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/stephan.thomasse/).

# Proceeding Researches

**Acyclic Orientation with Parity Constraints**  
   Matthieu Petiteau, Chaoliang Tang, Stephan Thomasse
We are understanding the case of cubic graph.

**Chromatic number of Light tournament**  
   Lucas Isenmann, Clara Marcille, Alantha Newman, Chaoliang Tang  
We have obtained slight improvedment of chromatic number of light tournament.

**Random Turan number of Grids**  
   Yaobin Chen, Jiaxi Nie, Chaoliang Tang  
We have answered the random turan number of certain grids.

**Linear Turan Number of small paths**  
   Chaoliang Tang, Hehui Wu, Junchi Zhang  
We have answered the linear Turan number of 5-path and this will be presented on [Eurocomb25](https://renyi.hu/en/events/conference/eurocomb25).

# Hobbies

**Cycling**: I used to be a member of Fudan University Cycling Team.

**Hiking**: Take me into mountains plz. I will be in Mont Blanc in the summer of 2025.

**Boardgames**: I can play the whole night.

Anything esle that is **dangerous**.

1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
