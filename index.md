# Hi!

Welcome to my homepage. I am a M2 student in [**ENS Lyon**](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/) at [**UMPA**](https://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/). I ambition to teach in universities or cram schools, which is why I sat the French exam "External Agregation" in **2024** in order to teach at universities or cram schools. See my [CV]() for more information.

Currently I am working in the [MC2 team](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/MC2/) in [LIP](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP) at **ENS Lyon**, where my supervisor is [**Stéphan Thomassé**](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/stephan.thomasse/).

# Research Interests

Structral Graph Theory
Metric Graph Theory

# Research Works

[**A Polynomial-Time Approximation Algorithm for Complete Interval Minors**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05997)  
Romain Bourneuf, Julien Cocquet, Chaoliang Tang, Stéphan Thomassé  

M1 reasearch internship : [**WL dimension and strong product**]
Gwenaël Joret

L3 research internship : [**VC-dimension of median graphs excluding cubes**] We showed that the VC-dimension of an hypercube is its dimension plus one, and that the VC-dimension of median graphs exluding cubes is at most 4 (and the bound is tight).
Victor Chepoi, Jérémy Chalopin 

# Teachings

I have given math oral exams ("Colles" in French) through the scholar 2025 year to MPSI and PSI students. I even gave individual lessons to some of my students at the end of the testing year.

# Conference and Seminars

**Godasse**, 2025, Sete, France  
**Patterns in ordered graphs**, at Godasse


# Hobbies

**VolleyBall** : I love this sport, except when it finishes with sprains. 

**Running** : I will run in the Alpes in summer 2025 for the first official run ever of my life.

**Boardgames**: I can play the whole night.

**Piano** : I have been practicing for 10 years, I would like to play in the OSGEL orchestra (maybe next year ?).

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
